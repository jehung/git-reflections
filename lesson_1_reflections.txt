1. Getting diff can isolate where the bugs get introduced.

2. Using diff can show where the changes are.

3. Version control faciliates comparing changes between any 2 versions.
   Version control helps sharing the code and working on it at the same time.
   
4. Mannual commits ensures that the commits have a logical flow to it. 
   Automatic commits usually will not provide logical flow.
   However, manual commits rely on the user's judgement call in the commit size.
   
5. Multiple files that impacts one another and that should be tracked at the 
   same time are called a repository. Commining not just a file, but 
   commiting the entire repository is helpful because it will keep the 
   logical reflationship intact.
   
6. Use git log to view logs
   Use git log --stat to view log with stats
   Use git diff commitstring commitstring to view the detailed changes between commits   
   
7. If you break something, you can always checkout an older version of code.
